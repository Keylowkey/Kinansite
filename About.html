      <h1>My story</h1>
      <p>As a kid, I did not know what field I wanted to walk into, I did not know

what my career path would be, and as a person I want everything I do to

have a purpose and I want to be benevolent to those around me. I could

not accept success from others or live off others' efforts, and as a result

my goals are very specific. I like to see whatever I design or develop to be useful for people, so after

a long internal conversation with myself, I have realized that I am

extremely creative and I like to see my work to be useful to others. I've

gotten in the music industry, and I can't lie, it has captured my heart. but advertising is a necessity in the music industry so I found

myself standing there with a complete album that I have mixed and

mastered, but barely any money to promote. After feeling useless like I was not a part of this society and not a part of

the growth of this nation, I decided to investigate fields such as web

design that would allow me to create whatever I imagine and to see it

come to life electronically. and of course I have a lot more to learn

my next step is learning app development.</p>
